## 🤖 Instructions for AI Assistants (Context Onboarding)

If you are an AI assistant tasked with answering questions, adding features, or debugging KAIO, follow this onboarding checklist:

### Step 1 — Read Architecture Documents
1. **`01_PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`** — Understand the system, tech stack, and current phase.
2. **`02_BACKEND_ARCHITECTURE.md`** — Read the DB rule, router list, auth mechanism, and service catalog.
3. **`03_FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md`** — Understand Zustand stores, feature structure, and cookie auth.
4. **`04_DATABASE_ARCHITECTURE.md`** — Learn canonical views, stored functions, and migration list.

### Step 2 — Critical Rules to Never Violate

> [!CAUTION]
> **Rule 1 — No Inline SQL**: Backend Python routers and services **MUST NEVER** write raw SQL (`SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`). All reads go through `v_*_canonical` views. All writes call `fn_*` stored procedures.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Rule 2 — Cookie Auth**: The auth system uses **httpOnly cookies** (`access_token`, `refresh_token`). Do NOT add `Authorization: Bearer` header logic to the frontend. Do NOT return tokens in response bodies. Use `withCredentials: true` on Axios.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Rule 3 — Zustand, not Context**: The frontend uses **Zustand v5** stores for all global state. Do NOT create React Context providers for global state. Use the appropriate existing store.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Rule 4 — React 19 + Tailwind v4**: The frontend is on React 19 and Tailwind CSS v4 (no `tailwind.config.js` — configured via CSS). Do not downgrade or introduce v3 patterns.

### Step 3 — Find Your Feature
- Use **`07_API_REFERENCE.md`** to look up backend endpoints.
- Use **`08_COMPONENT_REFERENCE.md`** to find frontend components.
- Use **`09_FOLDER_REFERENCE.md`** to locate files.
- Use **`10_CODE_EXECUTION_FLOW.md`** to trace request/response paths.

### Step 4 — User Credentials (Dev/Testing)
See **`USER_CREDENTIALS.md`** for seeded login credentials for both TechInnovators India and DevArc workspaces.
